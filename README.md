Neighborhood Map P5 Front-end Nanodegree
Project Overview

Developed a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood. Added additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

How do you start?

This application uses the Google Map API. The first step is to visit the site at https://developers.google.com/maps/. Familiarize yourself with the Google map and its many, many features. 

Next, I recommend you visit YouTube for a great tutorial on how to build your own map using the Google Map API. This is Google Map API tutorial 101 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE8ODPL2VPI&list=PLrtRjIOGYRowjKK0zR53AdAJzN7tqIV9H&index=1.

Once you learn how to add various components into a map, visit knockoujs.com to learn about knockout. Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display with a simple underlying data model. Any time you have sections of UI that update dynamically, KO can help you implement it more simply and maintainably. The tutorials are great! However, I am not sure if KO is the best solution for working with Google API for this project, but it is a good, simple way to learn data binding. 

Also, I used Materialize CSS framework. I like the colors and the responsive design and am just trying out. Let me know what you think of this framework. You can find more information at http://materializecss.com/.

Searching and Filtering

The application has a search/filter option on the existing map markers that are already displayed. These markers are a list of my favorite places in my neighborhood.

What APIs are used?

As mentioned above, I used Google Map API. In addition I used Flickr's API and YouTube embedded video. I could have used more APIs, but for the specific project I didn't see the need for more APIs. I used more assets from the Google Map API.

In addition to the simple map, I also used other assets, which I am keeping it as a surprise (perhaps) for the reading, to discover on their own what they find on the map. I recommend you go and double click on the file myNeighborhood.html and come and discover my neighborhood!
